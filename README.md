EV Charging Station CRM - track charging slots, payments, and breakdowns.
Problem Statement : With the increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the demand for efficient charging infrastructure is growing rapidly. However, EV charging station operators face challenges in managing charging slot reservations, tracking payments, and handling station breakdowns effectively. A lack of a centralized system often leads to customer dissatisfaction, revenue leakage, and operational inefficiencies. Therefore, there is a need for a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution that allows operators to manage charging slots, monitor payments, and log service breakdowns in real-time. This project aims to develop an EV Charging Station CRM on Salesforce to streamline operations, improve customer experience, and enhance service reliability.
